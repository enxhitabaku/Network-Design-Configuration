# Network-Design-Configuration
A small network designed and configurated using  Cisco Packet Tracer.

This project statisfies the following tasks :

Task 1: Use the Packet Tracer to design a network topology

Task 2: Assign to each of the devices(computers, routers etc) an IP address using as default Network
        IP address: 192.168.3.0 /24 (Use VLSM for subnetting)
        
Task 3 – Basic configuration of switches and routers

          Configure switches and routers for the following requirements:
          
                a. Hostname of the device 
                
                b. Restrict the access to the privileged mode of switch with hashed password
                
                c. Restrict the access to the privileged mode of router with hashed password 
                
                d. Protect the console and vty terminal lines (for switches and routers)using a local username 
                    and password (set as username your name and as password your surname)
                
Task 4 - VLAN and trunk configuration

          a.Creating VLAN-s
          
          b. Configure the Routing to VLANs using 802.1Q protocol on routers to make possible the connection
              between computers of different VLANs.
              
Task 5 – Configure the routers in order for PCs to have connectivity with each other

Task 6 – Configure the Administrator laptop

          a.Access the switch using telnet and SSH (configure the VLAN in the switch).
          
          b.Configure port security for the interface where the laptop is connected,
             use restrict violation mode.
